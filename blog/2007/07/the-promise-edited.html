                <h1>The Promise</h1>
                <p>7:00 a.m. / She slept soundly while the early morning light  kissed the creases of  her angelic face,  tracing shadows along her slender back and waist. Curled around her nimble  body, the white linen sheets drew around her like creased angel wings. She  twitched, and a gentle plume of fine dust gently spread, clearly visible like  angel dust shimmering in the morning light. </p>
                <p>A moment later, a rap-tap-tapping punctuated the morning  stillness. Her cellphone rang. The angel gently opened her eyes, revealing  hazel brown eyes, trying to shake the drowsiness away. She reached for it under  her pillow, turned, exposing her long thighs that bounced the morning rays. She  lifted the receiver and answered in a soft gentle voice, &quot;Yes,  hello?&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;How have you been? This is me.&quot; Upon hearing it,  she suddenly sat up on her bed, the linen almost falling, half-exposing her  half naked torso. It was him. Unmistakably. No one else had such rich dulcet  tones. His voice she had not heard for a really long time. A voice she wished  she would never hear. </p>
                <p>No words came out from her, as her throat suddenly went dry,  her tongue sticking to the top of her mouth. &quot;Hello? Are you still  there?&quot; the man asked. Realizing that she hasn’t said a word, she summoned  enough willpower to answer, &quot;Yes, I am. It's been a while.&quot; They  talked like this for a few more minutes. Always vague references to past  events. After she had hung up, her movements became brisk, purposeful. She got  up, showered and dressed in her usual jeans and blouse. Before she left for  work, she checked on something in her dresser. She opened a silver box, and  took a peek inside. “It’s still there,” she thought, and went straight to work.</p>
                <p> During the conversation, they agreed to meet by their favorite coffee shop  at 7 pm to catch up on old times. It had been ten years since they last saw  each other on that faithful day they broke up. “Promise me,” he said. She  nodded, and he turned and left her…the rain falling all’ round, mixing with the  warm tears from her bright eyes. </p>
                <p> She tried to banish all the thoughts of him from her mind. She still  couldn't concentrate on her job and kept thinking of what's going to happen  when both of their eyes met again after all those years. Hours passed by so  quickly and it was already six in the evening. She left one last look at her  work and said her daily goodbyes to her workmates and left hurriedly in her silver  Mazda 3, straight to the coffee shop. She arrived ten minutes before seven. “Just  enough time for me to relax, and collect my thoughts” she said to herself. But  to her surprise, he was already there. </p>
                <p> The shop owner, a long time friend, told her he was there 30 minutes early for  their agreed meeting. Of course, she was touched terribly and went straight to  the table where he was sitting for half an hour.</p>
                <p> With an apologetic smile, she said, &quot;Hi. I'm sorry you waited  long.&quot; Immediately, he smiled and replied, &quot;Hello. It's been a while.  Don't worry about it. I know you're busy and you aren't even late.&quot;  &quot;Still-&quot; she replied finding something else to start a conversation.  A few minutes of silence passed between them until he broke it with an offer of  something to eat. “Steak. T-bone. Medium-well.” He said. “Your favorite…it’s  not healthy for you.” She said. He smiled at her gently, “It shouldn’t matter  now, should it?” he asked. “I guess.” She answered, forcing a smile.</p>
                <p> They spent hours catching up with each other until finally, all the  customers have left. The store owner started to turn the tables, and smiled at  them as if to politely say, “lovers, move your business elsewhere.” They smiled  in turn and left for another place – They didn’t even have to plan, they knew  exactly where they were going - her pad. </p>
                <p> She offered her car and he offered to drive it to her place as both of them  agreed. It started to rain even while they were still in the café. In the car,  the rain reminded her of the night they last met. How fitting, she thought,  that it should rain today as well.</p>
                <p> As they drove, they pointed at streets they used to walk down together, and  the places they used to go to. Everything from their past came rushing through.  The happiness they spent together, the troubles they went through, their  dreams, their hopes and their pains. All of their feelings went back as if  their life's VCR were momentarily on rewind.</p>
                <p> The drive lasted almost forever. At last, they arrived at her place. “Make  yourself comfortable,” she said. “I’ll try. I have not been for so long,” he said.  “I know,” she answered, as she disappeared to the bedroom. She went to the dresser  to retrieve her precious box, opened it, and gently palmed it in her right  hand. She went to the kitchen and offered him a drink. Brandy, his favorite.  She stepped into the living room, and as she emerged, he looked at the scotch  in her left hand, and smiled. He looked at her right hand, and nodded  knowingly…forcing a smile on his lips. He took the drink and sipped slowly. Both  of them stared at the rain slowly dripping on the window for a while, as she  filled his glass again. &quot;It was a rainy night like this to, was it  not?&quot; She said, still staring at the window, breaking the silence between  them. Unsurprised, he looked at her for a moment and replied,  &quot;Yes...&quot; And he turned his face down. She stared at him for a few  seconds, the light from the street glowed dimly as it hit his face revealing  lines that were not there before. Time has not been kind she thought. Just  then, even without her consciously thinking, she touched his face, caressed it  gently. Her hand then went down and took the glass of scotch from him. Her lips  gently touched that cold glass as the red blood liquid rushed down her dry  throat. &quot;It's good isn’t it?&quot; She said. &quot;I brought it home the  last time I went to Europe.&quot; She added.  He smiled, and faced her again, took the drink from her and replied, &quot;Yes.  It is.&quot; She looked at him, not uttering anything. He held her right hand  and softly whispered, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; She, in return, held and again caressed  his face and gently pulled him to her lips, closed her eyes and finally, kissed  his warm lips as he wrapped his free arm around her tightly.</p>
                <p> She felt a sudden jerk, and she felt warm tears – hers – trickle down her  face.</p>
                <p> They stayed locked like this for minutes, his warm lips slowly turned cold  as the once reddish color turned blue. The glass of scotch fell and broke on  the floor behind her. She opened her eyes and broke away from his embrace. His  face was now ashen, a pale blue illuminated by the anemic light from the  streets below.  She looked at her hands,  blood stained, numb and warm from the rich velvet fluid from the wound in his  chest.  With lips trembling, she held his  face, and said with a cracking voice “I kept my promise…” He looked at her, his  eyes without condemnation and whispered, &quot;Yes, thank you. And I'm  sorry.&quot; as he slowly closed his eyes, the last picture he saw was her angelic  face in blood and tears.</p>
